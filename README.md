# Mapping Uzbekistan Sardoba dam failure 
Mapped the May 1, 2020 Sardoba dam failure in Uzbekistan using satellite imagery and GIS analysis to identify flood pathways, inundated areas, and affected settlements, producing an interpretable crisis-response map to support damage assessment and emergency planning.

## Project Structure
- `data` - All data, map layers, and vectors used for map creation.
- `report.pdf` - Final map output with report and map itself.
- `guide.docx` - Guidelines for the project. 

## Key Insights
- Georeferenced pre- and post-failure satellite imagery to reconstruct reservoir boundaries, flood pathways, and pooled inundation zones with spatial accuracy.
- Quantified impact extent, estimating ~342 km² flood pathway and ~191 km² inundated area, affecting four villages and one lake region.
- Identified directly impacted settlements by spatially intersecting flood polygons with village point data, enabling targeted evacuation and response prioritization.
- Designed clear symbology and map layout to distinguish flood movement, pooled water, infrastructure, and affected populations for rapid interpretation by non-technical audiences.

## Tools & Technologies
 - **ArcGIS Pro - raster analysis, geoprocessing**
- **QGIS**
